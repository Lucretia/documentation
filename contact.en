Mailing lists
=============

There are a couple of AROS-related mailing lists available, which are the main
channels of information and discussion about AROS for developers. The
following mailings lists are available:

+ `AROS Developer`__

  This is the developer mailing list, where discussions about the development
  of AROS are held. Also, the nightly build status is posted daily to this
  list. Submissions to the `bug database`_ are posted to this list, too.
  It is **highly** recommended for developers to join this list, as
  it will otherwise be quite hard to keep up to date on current developments.
  Since there aren't *that* many AROS developers, the volume on this list is
  generally quite low, but it can become quite high during heated discussions.

  .. Note:: Subscription requests to this list are not handled automatically,
            but every request is verified by the list administrator. So, there
            might be some delay from the time you send a subscription request
            to when you actually become a member.

+ `AROS CVS`__

  This is a read-only developer mailing list, to which logs are automatically
  posted whenever something is commited to the AROS repositories.  If you want
  almost real-time feedback on the commit activity in the AROS repositories,
  this is the list for you. The volume of traffic to this list can be very high.

+ `AROS Website`__

  The website build script sends mail to this list, so that developers involved
  in its operation and maintenance can fix issues when they arise.

Community Resources
===================

There are a number of community created resources that can be usefull sources
of information for users and developers alike. A few of them are listed below.


------
Forums
------

AROS-Exec__ is a popular community portal for AROS. There, you can find the
latest news related to AROS, online discussion forums, picture galleries, and
much more. It's the perfect meeting place for AROS users from all over the
world, and a few AROS core developers are known to frequent there.

IRC Channels
------------

Probably the best known IRC channel for AROS, is unsurprisingly named `#aros`__, on
the FreeNode__ network. Please connect to `irc.freenode.net`__, which will
redirect to a server close to you. It's for discussing everything and anything
related to AROS, including development and how to take over the world. On rare
occasions, when the main channel is very noisy, development-related
discussions move to `#aros.dev`__.
